# Raising a new issue & requesting Features

Thanks for being an A* tester and helping to make Wavebox better by either reporting a bug or raising an issue! Before you create a new issue here are a few things that might be worth checking first...

1. Make sure you're using the latest version. These are available to download on the wavebox.io download page [https://wavebox.io/download](https://wavebox.io/download)

2.  Take a quick look to see if anyone else has already raised an issue on the [issues page](https://github.com/wavebox/waveboxapp/issues). It makes it much easier to track a discussion around a single issue rather than dealing with duplicates

Once you're happy that your issue / feature hasn't already been raised or fixed feel free to raise it!
